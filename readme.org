* Spacesuit
* Synopsis
  Minimal single-file testing lib
* Usage
  https://github.com/kidd/spacesuit.lua/blob/master/spacesuit.lua#L99-L145
* Motivation
  There are quite a few other testing libs for lua, and I'm usually in
  favor of contributing before forking another 80% solution.

  While writting some minimal tests with assert, I started to write
  assert_equal, then assert_equal_rec, etc... And saw that I was
  basically rewriting busted. Then I decided to rewrite a minimal part
  of busted that doesn't include outputters, or compatibility for
  windows, or anything. also, not so much syntax sugar (I'm not a big
  fan of rspec syntax)

  So playing with wrappers and metatables I arrived to an
  implementation of spies that is very similar to what luassert
  offers. but without the entanglement with any other lib.

  It has bugs for sure (nils are not treated properly yet), but was a
  nice learning exercise.
